</div>
Local represenatitve along with Dr. Jule Neumann and Dr. Guannan Wen, and external representatitve at the PostdocNet. 

We represent the interests of postdoctoral researchers within the MPI for Evolutionary Biology. Our tasks include: facilitate communication between postdocs, and local administration to address concerns and provide feedback.
Organize local Postdoc Retreat and social events to foster a sense of community among postdocs.

As an external representative at the PostdocNet, I represent the postdocs from the MPI for Evolutionary Biology, communicate with the PostDocNet Steering Group, and also distribute their announcements. 

### Leader of the Onboarding Working Group

</div>
   The Onboarding Working Group helps MPG postdocs and their families have a smooth start and pleasant journey in MPG and in Germany.

   I first joined the Onboarding Working Group as a member (Feb. 2022 to Feb. 2023), then co-leader with Rana Amini from Feb./2023 to Feb./2024, then becoming the leader from Feb. 2024 onwards. 

   As a member of this working group, I participated in the discussions related to Onboarding issues at the Max Planck Society (MPG). I also helped write the PostdocNet Welcome Package, which aims to provide a concise and transparent guide to the German Social Security System, the German Salary Scheme System, as well as differences between contracts, stipends, and fellowships to MPG postdocs.

   As a leader of this working group, I also have the privilege to represent the working group in PostdocNet events, as well as to collaborate with Max Planck Central Administration on Onboarding issues and our Welcome Package.
