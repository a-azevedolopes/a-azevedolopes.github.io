      I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in the <a href='https://theobio.evolbio.mpg.de/#home' target='_blank'>Department of Theoretical Biology</a> led by Arne Traulsen in Plön.

      My research focuses on game theoretic modeling, numerical simulations, and data analysis to study topics related to ecology and evolution, with a particular interest in microbial systems, microbiomes and antimicrobial resistance, evolutionary game theory, and the evolution of cooperation.
    
      My background is in theoretical physics, where I've developed a strong foundation in mathematical modeling and complex systems. My PhD research focused on out-of-equilibrium statistical mechanics, in particular its geometrical aspects, such as coarsening and percolation. I have always been interested in complex systems and their emergent properties, and now I'm excited to apply these skills to understand the intricacies of ecology and evolution.
    
      Here, you'll find information about my research, publications, and other projects.
